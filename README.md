This is a Full Stack App, you just have to run the little dump in sql-scrips, then fill in the application.properties on the backend and the .env file on the frontend. The app is fully responsive for desktop and mobile.
I have auth0 and stripe integrations to make it more complex, additionally I have a custom exception, a global exception handler and tests.
