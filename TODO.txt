This will be a SHIRT SHOP

I will make the whole app with React Router Links and Navlinks

I can't insert images as base64 in mysql everything crashes.
Store the images on the frontend and their directories in mysql, then use "require" to retrieve the images and adjust the path.
Require does not work with with variables, it need a string literal.

Two options either store the images as bytes in blobs or use store the images in react's public folder and store the directories in the database.

I will store the images into DB using Spring APP.

Just store the images via the Spring App.
